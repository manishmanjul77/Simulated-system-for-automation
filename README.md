# Simulated Environment For Automation

A team project by Manish Manjul, Aagam Jain and Vineet Goyal.<br/>A web simulated environment/portal for users which is used for learning of artificial intelligence techniques using the virtual hardware set of sensors and actuators.<br/>This projects includes the concept of Object detection, Deep learning and Web development along with cloud server operations.<br/>The virtual environment deals the robotic processing in form of colour recognition, multi-class and binary object recognition, real-world results after sensorâ€™s input calculation.
<br/>The hardware based simulation is based on EV3 Core set and Raspberry Pi along with Pixy 2 Camera for virtually image recognition.
<br/>Multiclass classification on object detection by CNN and drag and drop functionality of virtual hardware.
